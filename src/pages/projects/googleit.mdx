"Google Replicate" is a project that I developed using React, Tailwind, and React Router. This project was created to demonstrate my skills in web development and showcase my ability to build complex and feature-rich applications.

The project involves replicating the functionality and design of the Google search engine, providing users with a familiar and intuitive interface for searching the web. Using React, I implemented dynamic components and interactive user interfaces that allow users to search for and display search results in real-time.

Additionally, I utilized Tailwind, a utility-first CSS framework, to create a responsive and visually appealing design that closely resembles the Google search engine. React Router was also used to handle routing and navigation between different pages of the application.
