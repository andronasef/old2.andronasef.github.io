[Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt), the land of ancient wonders and mystical history, has always been a source of fascination for people around the world. The majestic pyramids, the mystical temples, and the stories of pharaohs and their riches, have all contributed to the country's allure.

As a Egyptian, I wanted to find a way to make the wonders of Egypt more accessible to people who may not be able to travel there in person for now but also motivates them to experience it firsthand by visiting my beloved homeland. That's when the idea for Egyquest was born.

With [Egyquest](http://andronasef.github.io/egyquest), users can explore Egypt's most iconic places using Google Street View, The project was inspired by the need to encourage tourism to Egypt, and to provide an innovative way for people to discover this amazing country.

As the [developer](https://andronasef.github.io/) behind [Egyquest](https://andronasef.github.io/egyquest), my name is [Andrew Nasef,](https://andronasef.github.io/) and I am dedicated to creating [projects](https://andronasef.github.io/projects) that combine my passion for technology with my love of exploring the world. I believe that through projects like [Egyquest](https://andronasef.github.io/egyquest), we can help people discover new cultures, learn about history, and gain a greater appreciation for the world we live in.

**Note:** the main idea was inspired from [Wonders of Street View](https://neal.fun/wonders-of-street-view/) by [@nealagarwal](https://twitter.com/nealagarwal).
