Alhirfa is a Saudi e-commerce store that showcases and sells handcrafted products that embody the Kingdom's rich cultural heritage.

The site was designed using WordPress and features a user-friendly interface and attractive design. The store offers a wide variety of Saudi handcrafted products, including jewelry, clothing, and artwork.

Objectives:

- Providing an online platform for showcasing and selling Saudi handcrafted products.
- Educating local and international audiences about Saudi cultural heritage.
- Supporting Saudi artisans and promoting their skills and creativity.

Note: I have continue the work on Alhirfa, and these are the results after my arrival.

Results

- Increased website speed by four times

  The site initially took 8 seconds to load a full page, but now it takes only 2 seconds. This was achieved by changing the hosting provider and making several WordPress settings adjustments to improve performance.

- Resolved email delivery issues
  Emails sent through WordPress were previously not reaching customers. This issue has been resolved by improving email formatting to match the visual identity of the Alhirfa store.

- Added Google Analytics to track website visitor data
  This will enable the store to improve the user experience and increase sales.
